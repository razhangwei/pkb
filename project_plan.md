# Personal Knowledge Base Management System

## Overview
This project aims to create a personal knowledge base management system using llama-index to index and query various personal knowledge collections, including Obsidian notes, PDF papers, and Calibre library (EPUB files).

## Components

1. Data Sources:
   - Obsidian notes (Markdown files)
   - PDF papers
   - Calibre library (EPUB files)

2. Indexing System:
   - llama-index for creating and managing the index

3. Backend:
   - Python-based server (e.g., Flask or FastAPI)

4. Frontend:
   - Simple web-based UI for interaction

5. Query Processing:
   - Natural language processing to handle user queries

## Detailed Component Descriptions

### 1. Data Sources
- Obsidian notes: Use a file system loader to read Markdown files
- PDFs: Use a PDF loader (provided by llama-index)
- EPUB files: Create a custom loader or use an existing EPUB parser

### 2. Indexing System
- Use llama-index to create an index from all data sources
- Implement periodic updates to keep the index fresh
- Consider using different index types for different data sources if needed

### 3. Backend
- Create a Python-based server using Flask or FastAPI
- Implement API endpoints for:
  - Querying the knowledge base
  - Updating the index
  - Managing data sources (add/remove)

### 4. Frontend
- Develop a simple web-based UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Include a chat-like interface for querying
- Add options for managing data sources and triggering index updates

### 5. Query Processing
- Use llama-index's query processing capabilities
- Implement follow-up questions and context management for a more natural conversation flow

## Additional Considerations
- Authentication: Implement user authentication to keep personal data secure
- Data Privacy: Ensure all processing happens locally or on a trusted server
- Scalability: Design the system to handle growing amounts of data efficiently
- Customization: Allow for custom tags or categories to organize knowledge

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up the development environment and install necessary libraries
2. Create data loaders for each source type
3. Implement the indexing system using llama-index
4. Develop the backend server with API endpoints
5. Create the frontend UI
6. Integrate all components and test the system
7. Implement additional features like authentication and customization
